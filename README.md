# Simple Data Fetching with Axios and Vite React

This repository demonstrates how to perform simple data fetching using Axios with Vite and React. Axios is a popular HTTP client for making asynchronous requests, and Vite is a fast build tool that provides instant server start and blazing fast builds for modern JavaScript applications.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-data-fetching.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd simple-data-fetching
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```
   yarn
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view your React application in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How it Works

1. **Axios Setup**: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. In this project, Axios is used to make HTTP requests to a sample API endpoint.

2. **Fetching Data**: Inside the React component (`App.js`), there is an example of fetching data from an API using Axios. The `useEffect` hook is utilized to perform the data fetching when the component mounts.

3. **Displaying Data**: Once the data is fetched successfully, it is displayed in the UI. You can modify `App.js` to format and display the data as needed for your application.

## Folder Structure

- **public**: Contains the HTML template and other static assets.
- **src**: Contains the React components and application logic.
  - **components**: Contains reusable React components.
  - **App.js**: The main React component where data fetching is demonstrated.
- **package.json**: Contains project metadata and dependencies.
- **vite.config.js**: Configuration file for Vite.

## Customize

Feel free to customize and extend this project according to your needs. You can modify the Axios configuration, add additional API endpoints, or integrate other libraries as required.
